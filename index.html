        <h2>Engine Abilities</h2>
    </div>
    <p>
        With this engine you can write a game in Python. SDL2 features are used in C++ functions that are exposed via
        Pybind11. We have recreated the game Galaga in python, but other games can be created as well! There is also a
        tile map editor you can use to create your own tile map, by putting in the complete file path of an image you
        want to use and the tile map dimensions you want. You can also preview sprite animations, by using the sprite
        animation tool and putting in the complete file path of the image you want to use, how big you want the sprite
        to be, and the start and end frame number.</p>
    <div ALIGN=CENTER>
        <h2>Galaga</h2>
    </div>
    <p>
        In order to move the spaceship use A and D, and to shoot your enemies use spacebar. You can quit the game by
        pressing Q. You have 3 lives so be careful! There are no levels, but as time goes on the game gets more
        challenging.

    <div ALIGN=CENTER>
        <h2> Post Mortem </h2>
    </div>
    <p> A project like a game engine is never fully completed. If there was more time there are many things we would
        have like to try to implement. We would have liked to try to optimize our collision handling system, perhaps by
        implement a broad phase and narrow phase system. Also we could have exposed more SDL2 features to python, so
        users creating their game in python could have more creative control when developing the game.
    </p>
    <p>We would have also liked to add other tools. It would have been nice if we could have created a paint like tool
        that users could use to create their own background images and characters, instead of making it on another
        platform and saving it and loading it from there. Another tool that would have been useful is a simulation tool
        used to view how collisions are handled.

        <h2> Project Files, Binaries, & Documentation </h2>
    </div>
    <p>The following libraries are needed in order to run the game: Tkinter, PyQT, Pybind11, SDL2, SDL_Mixer, SDL_ttf,
        and
        SDL_image.
    </p>
    <p>Run the following in order to build the executable <code> python build.py</code>. After you can run the
        following to start the engine and play a game, use the sprite tool, and tile map tool.
        <code> ./bin/start</code> .</p>
